<h2><a name="general"></a>Game</h2>
<p style="font-size:30px"> Metal Gear Solid[a] is an action-adventure stealth video game produced by Konami Computer Entertainment Japan and           released for the PlayStation in 1998. The game was directed, produced, and co-written by series creator Hideo Kojima,           and serves as a sequel to the MSX2 video games Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, which Kojima also wrote and           directed.[5]
		
		Metal Gear Solid follows Solid Snake, a soldier who infiltrates a nuclear weapons facility to neutralize the terrorist           threat from FOXHOUND, a renegade special forces unit.[6] Snake must liberate two hostages, the head of DARPA and the           president of a major arms manufacturer, confront the terrorists, and stop them from launching a nuclear strike.[7]           Cinematic cutscenes were rendered using the in-game engine and graphics, and voice acting was used throughout the           entire game.[8]
		
		Metal Gear Solid was well received, shipping more than six million copies,[9] and scoring an average of 94/100 on the           aggregate website Metacritic.[10] It is regarded as one of the greatest and most important games of all time,[11][12]           and is often seen as the game which helped popularize the stealth genre. The commercial success of the title prompted           the release of an expanded version for the PlayStation and PC, titled Metal Gear Solid: Integral;[13] and a remake,           Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes was later released for the GameCube.[14][15] sThe game has also spawned numerous           sequels, prequels and spin-offs, including several games, a radio drama, comics, and novels.</p>

<h2><a name="gameplay"></a>Gameplay</h2>
<p style="font-size:30px"> The player must navigate the protagonist, Solid Snake, through the game's areas without being detected by enemies.[16] 		        Detection is triggered by the player moving into an enemy's field of vision and sets off an alarm that draws armed        enemies to his location.[17] This also triggers "alert mode" and the player must then hide and remain undetected, at        which point “evasion mode” begins and once the counter reaches zero the game returns to "infiltration mode" wher        enemies are not suspicious of Snake’s presence. The radar cannot be used in alert or evasion mode. In addition the stealth gameplay, there are set piece sequences that entail firefights between the player and enemies.
		
		To remain undetected, the player can perform techniques which make use of both Solid Snake's abilities and the                  environment, such as crawling under objects, using boxes as cover, ducking or hiding around walls, and making noise to         distract enemies. An on-screen radar provides the player with location of nearby enemies and their field of                  vision. Snake can also make use of many items and gadgets, such as infra-red goggles and a cardboard box                    disguise. The emphasis on stealth promotes a less violent form of gameplay, as fights against large groups of                    enemies will often result in serious damage for the player.[21]
		
		Despite the switch to 3D, the game is still played primarily from an overhead perspective similar to the original 2D           Metal Gear games. However, the camera angle will change during certain situations, such as a corner view when Snake           flattens himself to a wall next to an open space, or into first-person when crawling under tight spaces or using           certain items such as the binoculars or a sniper rifle. The player can also use the first-person view while remaining           idle to look around Snake's surroundings or see what's ahead of him.
		
		Progress is punctuated by cutscenes and codec, as well as encounters with bosses. To progress, players must discover 		           the weaknesses of each boss and defeat them. Play controls and strategies can also be accessed via the Codec radio, 	           where advice is delivered from Snake's support team; for example, the support team may chastise Snake for not saving 	           his progress often enough, or explain his combat moves in terms of which buttons to press on the gamepad. The Codec is           also used to provide exposition on the game's backstory.
		
		Upon completion of the main story, a result screen is shown after the ending credits, which displays a statistics of           the player's performance. The player is evaluated with a codename (most of them animal-based) based on the number of           alerts triggered, rations used and enemies killed throughout their playthrough, along with the total playtime, saves,           and continues used after a game over. There are a total of 12 codenames for each difficulty level, with the best           possible rank on the hardest setting being "Big Boss".
		
		In addition to the main story, there's also a VR training mode in which the player can test out their sneaking skills           in a series of artificially constructed environments. This mode is divided into three main categories (practice, time           attack, and gun shooting), each consisting of ten stages. After completing all 30 stages, a survival mission is           unlocked in which the player must proceed through all ten gun shooting stages in a row under a seven-minute limit.</p>

<h2><a name="characters"></a>Characters</h2>
<p style="font-size:30px"> The protagonist is Solid Snake, a legendary infiltrator and saboteur. During the mission, Snake receives support and 					           advice via codec radio. Colonel Roy Campbell, Solid Snake's former commanding officer, supports Snake with advice and           tactics. While he initially keeps a number of secrets from Snake, he gradually reveals them.[22] He is joined by Naomi 		   Hunter, who gives medical advice; Nastasha Romanenko, who provides item and weapon tips; Master Miller, a former drill           instructor and survival coach; and Mei Ling, who invented the soliton radar system used in the mission and is also in           charge of mission data; the player can call her to save the game.
		
		The main antagonist of the game is Liquid Snake, leader of a now-terrorist splinter cell of the organization FOXHOUND,           and genetic counterpart to Solid Snake.[18] An elite special forces unit, FOXHOUND contains experts specializing in           unique tasks. Members are Revolver Ocelot, a Western-style gunslinger and expert interrogator whose weapon of choice           is the Colt Single Action Army; Sniper Wolf, a preternatural sniper; Vulcan Raven, a hulking Alaskan shaman armed with           an M61 Vulcan torn from a downed F-16; Psycho Mantis, a psychic profiler and psychokinesis expert; and Decoy Octopus,           a master of disguise.[18]
		
		Other characters include Meryl Silverburgh, Colonel Campbell's niece and a rookie soldier stationed in Shadow Moses           who did not join the revolt; Dr. Hal Emmerich, the lead developer of Metal Gear REX; and the "Ninja", a mysterious           cybernetically enhanced agent who is neither an ally nor an enemy of Snake but does oppose FOXHOUND.</p>

<h2><a name="music"></a>Music</h2>
<p style="font-size:30px"> The musical score of Metal Gear Solid was composed by Konami's in-house musicians, including Kazuki Muraoka, Hiroyuki            Togo, Takanari Ishiyama, Lee Jeon Myung, and Maki Kirioka. Composer and lyricist Rika Muranaka provided a song called            "The Best is Yet To Come" for the game's ending credits sequence.[57] The song is performed in Irish by Aoife Ní            Fhearraigh.[58] The main theme was composed by Tappi Iwase from the Konami Kukeiha Club.
		
		Music played in-game has a synthetic feel with increased pace and introduction of strings during tense moments, with            a looping style endemic to video games. Overtly cinematic music, with stronger orchestral and choral elements,            appears in cutscenes. The soundtrack was released on September 23, 1998, under the King Records label.</p>
