		<h1 class="title">Metal Gear Solid</h1>
		
		<p id="txt-start">Metal Gear Solid</p>
			
		<p>is an action-adventure stealth video game produced by Konami Computer Entertainment Japan and released for the PlayStation in 1998. The game was directed, produced, and co-written by series creator Hideo Kojima, and serves as a sequel to the MSX2 video games Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, which Kojima also wrote and directed.</p>
		
		<p class="clear">Metal Gear Solid follows Solid Snake, a soldier who infiltrates a nuclear weapons facility to neutralize the terrorist threat from FOXHOUND, a 					 		renegade special forces unit. Snake must liberate two hostages, the head of DARPA and the president of a major arms manufacturer, confront the 		 				 		terrorists, and stop them from launching a nuclear strike. Cinematic cutscenes were rendered using the in-game engine and graphics, and voice 	 					 		acting was used throughout the entire game.</p>
		
		<p>Metal Gear Solid was well received, shipping more than six million copies, and scoring an average of 94/100 on the aggregate website Metacritic. It is regarded as one of the greatest and most important games of all time, and is often seen as the game which helped popularize the stealth  genre. The commercial success of the title prompted the release of an expanded version for the PlayStation and PC, titled Metal Gear Solid:  		 				 		Integral; and a remake, Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes was later released for the GameCube. The game has also spawned numerous sequels,  		 			 		prequels and spin-offs, including several games, a radio drama, comics, and novels.</p>
