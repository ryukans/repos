	<h2>Metal Gear Solid</h2>
	
	<br />
	
	<h3>Game</h3>
	
	<p id="Generic">Metal Gear Solid is an action-adventure stealth video game produced by Konami Computer Entertainment Japan and 
	released for the PlayStation in 1998. The game was directed, produced, and co-written by series creator <span>Hideo Kojima</span>, 
	and serves as a sequel to the MSX2 video games Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, which Kojima also wrote 
	and directed.</p>

	<h3>Plot</h3>
	
	<p id="Plot" >The player must navigate the protagonist, Solid Snake, through the game's areas without being detected by enemies.
	Detection is triggered by the player moving into an enemy's field of vision and sets off an alarm that draws
	armed enemies to his location. This also triggers "alert mode" and the player must then hide and remain
	undetected, at which point “evasion mode” begins and once the counter reaches zero the game returns to
	"infiltration mode" where enemies are not suspicious of Snake’s presence. The radar cannot be used in alert or 
	evasion mode. In addition to the stealth gameplay, there are set piece sequences that entail firefights between 
	the player and enemies. To remain undetected, the player can perform techniques which make use of both 
	Solid Snake's abilities and the environment, such as crawling under objects, using boxes as cover, ducking or 
	hiding around walls, and making noise to distract enemies. An on-screen radar provides the player with location 
	of nearby enemies and their field of vision. Snake can also make use of many items and gadgets, such as 
	infra-red goggles and a cardboard box disguise. The emphasis on stealth promotes a less violent form of 
	gameplay, as fights against large groups of enemies will often result in serious damage for the player.
	Despite the switch to 3D, the game is still played primarily from an overhead perspective similar to the original 2D 
	Metal Gear games. However, the camera angle will change during certain situations, such as a corner view when 
	Snake flattens himself to a wall next to an open space, or into first-person when crawling under tight spaces 
	or using certain items such as the binoculars or a sniper rifle. The player can also use the first-person view
	while remaining idle to look around Snake's surroundings or see what's ahead of him. Progress is punctuated 
	by cutscenes and codec, as well as encounters with bosses. To progress, players must 
	discover the weaknesses of each boss and defeat them. Play controls and strategies can also be accessed via the 
	Codec radio, where advice is delivered from Snake's support team; for example, the support team may chastise Snake 
	for not saving his progress often enough, or explain his combat moves in terms of which buttons to press on the 
	gamepad. The Codec is also used to provide exposition on the game's backstory. Upon completion of the main 
	story, a result screen is shown after the ending credits, which displays a statistics of the player's performance. 
	The player is evaluated with a codename (most of them animal-based) based on the number of alerts triggered, 
	rations used and enemies killed throughout their playthrough, along with the total playtime, saves, and continues 
	used after a game over. There are a total of 12 codenames for each difficulty level, with the best possible rank 
	on the hardest setting being "Big Boss". In addition to the main story, there's also a VR training mode in which 
	the player can test out their sneaking skills in a series of artificially constructed environments. This mode is 
	divided into three main categories (practice, time attack, and gun shooting), each consisting of ten stages. After 
	completing all 30 stages, a survival mission is unlocked in which the player must proceed through all ten gun 
    shooting stages in a row under a seven-minute limit.</p>
